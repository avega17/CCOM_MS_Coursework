\section{Introduction}



\subsection{[Thesis] General Objective}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \textbf{Regional-scale surveys} of distributed rooftop PV solar panels, and \textbf{site-level, short-term forecasting} of solar irradiance used to estimate local PV power generation. \\
    \\
    This assessment will primarily produce counts of installed systems, estimates of surface area, installed generation capacity while monitoring will provide estimates for local solar irradiance used to model forecasts of PV energy generation at specific sites. \\
    \\ 
    The work developed for this thesis proposals is particularly inspired by and seeks to build upon the work realized, methodologies outlined, research gaps identified, and future work outlined in \cite{maxar_germany_pv_dataset}, \cite{Hu_solar_array_pitfalls_2022}, \cite{de-Hoog_sota_survey_2020}, \cite{Bansal_ssl_nowcasting_2022}, \cite{He_universal_pv_spectral_index_2024}, \cite{Jiang_rooftop_pv_assessment_2022}, \cite{Tremenbert_Kasmi_pyPV_roof_2023}, and \cite{Yu_deep_solar_2018}.

\subsection{[Thesis] Specific Objectives}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Survey of rooftop Solar Panel \textit{Arrays} via Small Object Detection and Instance Segmentation using \href{https://www.maxar.com/maxar-intelligence/constellation}{very-high-spatial-resolution imagery} of installation locations sourced from a \textbf{global} inventory of labeled PV arrays collated from multiple published datasets 
        \item Spatio-temporal Data Fusion for \textit{Multispectral} satellite sensors to get higher temporal resolution for local reflectance data 
        \item Near-term \textit{site-level} forecasting of solar irradiance [specify: global horizontal, direct normal, and/or diffuse horizontal irradiance] used for PV power estimates
    \end{enumerate}
    
\subsection{[Thesis] Contribution Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Measure performance impact of modern Computer Vision architectures (e.g. Vision Transformers, Swin Transformer, CNN-Transformer hybrids) using much higher resolution imagery than most published studies 
        \item Measure impact of use of PV-specific spectral indices and specifically the benefits of including NIR + SWIR bands
        \item Develop a solution that consciously tackles the challenges identified in \cite{Hu_solar_array_pitfalls_2022} for evaluating and performing comparisons of different remote sensing solar array assessment methodologies (distribution drift, test data quality, level of spatial-aggregation, and proprietary data)
    \end{enumerate}

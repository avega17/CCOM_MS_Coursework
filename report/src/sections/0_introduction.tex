\section{Introduction}



\subsection{General Objective}
    \vspace{0.5cm}
    
    \textbf{Regional-scale surveys} of distributed \textit{rooftop PV solar panels}, and \textbf{site-level, short-term forecasting} of \textit{solar irradiance} used to estimate local PV power generation. \\
    \\
    This assessment will primarily produce counts of installed systems, estimates of surface area, estimated PV generation potential while monitoring will provide forecasts of local solar irradiance which are used to model estimates of PV energy generation at specific sites. \\
    \\ 
    The work developed for this thesis proposal is particularly inspired by and seeks to build upon the work realized, methodologies outlined, research gaps identified, and future work outlined in \cite{maxar_germany_pv_dataset}, \cite{Hu_solar_array_pitfalls_2022}, \cite{de-Hoog_sota_survey_2020}, \cite{Bansal_ssl_nowcasting_2022}, \cite{He_universal_pv_spectral_index_2024}, \cite{Jiang_rooftop_pv_assessment_2022}, \cite{Tremenbert_Kasmi_pyPV_roof_2023}, and \cite{Yu_deep_solar_2018}.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Survey of rooftop Solar Panel \textit{Arrays} via Small Object Detection and Instance Segmentation using \href{https://www.maxar.com/maxar-intelligence/constellation}{very-high-spatial-resolution imagery} ($\leq1$ meter/pixel) of installation locations sourced from a \textbf{global} inventory of labeled PV arrays collated from multiple scientific dataset publications [add citations] 
        \item \textit{Near-term site-level} \textbf{forecasting of solar Global Horizontal  Irradiance} used to estimate PV power generation via data fusion with Spatio-temporal context from:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Time-series frames from geostationary satellite sensors with coarse spatial resolution, but high-temporal resolution (intra-hour scans)
            \item Historical Solar irradiance (e.g. NREL's National Solar Radiation Database)
            \item Any available PV power generation ground-truth time series
        \end{itemize}
        
    \end{enumerate}
    
\subsection{Contribution Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Measure performance impact of modern Computer Vision architectures (e.g. Vision Transformers, Swin Transformer, CNN-Transformer hybrids) using much higher resolution imagery than most published research 
        \item Measure impact of use of PV-specific spectral indices and specifically the benefits of including NIR + SWIR bands
        \item Develop a solution that consciously tackles the challenges identified in \cite{Hu_solar_array_pitfalls_2022} for evaluating and performing comparisons of different remote sensing solar array assessment methodologies (distribution drift, test data quality, level of spatial-aggregation, and proprietary data)
    \end{enumerate}

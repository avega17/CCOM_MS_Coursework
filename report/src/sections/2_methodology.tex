\section{Methodology}
\textbf{Here you will describe your:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experiments done and pending
    \item Tools, software, code 
    \item Data available (Description, source)
    \item Results (if any)    
\end{itemize} 
Create a subsection for each part described in the methodology. These subsections can be modified based on the work or progress made during the current month. Additionally, you may create separate sections if needed, for example, to distinguish results based on different strategies. This template is flexible and can be adapted for better presentation.
